Albert is an autograder.
It supports users as teachers and students, with different abilities for each.
It has problemsets, which contain problems a teacher can create and enable or disable easily.
Once a student has an account they can use a 'join code' to join a class, which gives them access to the problems and submissions.
The teacher can quickly look at submission, and there (will be) ability to have a human-graded custom rubric outside of the autograder's test cases, such as comments or finesse.
