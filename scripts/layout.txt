Interactive Autograder
This version of autograder interacts with program
Teacher makes program that receives user imput and then outputs
this is then run alongside the user program, so that the autograder can respond to user program

example: number guessing game

make two shells
in one run teacher program
take that output and put as input to user
in other put user program
output goes to teacher program as input
if user program has no runtime errors, teacher program 

Static Autograder
What already excists, gives premapped input to output, program given input must produce output

Note: Everything by ID
IDs MUST BE UNIQUE
